####Description
Wage Worth is my first Android app. It's written for Android 4.0+.

WageWorth is a stopwatch timer that keeps track of how much you earn based on your inputted hourly rate. 
Just set your rate in the settings popup and start the timer. You can start, pause, stop, and reset the timer. See the actual timer counting while your income increases!

This app is free to use and edit. The signed apk ("WageWorth.apk") is in the main directory.
